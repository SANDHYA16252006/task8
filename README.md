In this task, I performed K-Means clustering on the Mall Customers dataset to group customers based on their annual income and spending score. The goal was to learn how unsupervised learning works by identifying natural patterns or clusters in the data. First, I cleaned the dataset by removing unnecessary columns like CustomerID and Gender, which are not useful for clustering. Then, I standardized the data to make all features comparable. To decide how many clusters to use, I applied the Elbow Method, which helped me identify that 5 clusters was a good choice. I then trained the K-Means model and assigned each customer to a cluster. To visualize the customer segments clearly, I used PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the data to 2 dimensions and plotted it. Finally, I evaluated how good the clustering was using the Silhouette Score, which tells how well the clusters are formed. Through this task, I learned how to apply K-Means, choose the right number of clusters, and visually interpret the results of clustering in Python using scikit-learn.
